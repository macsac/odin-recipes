           Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing 
           from Naples. When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, 
           crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle 
           of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.</p>
